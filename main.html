        <h2>Reflection on APQ and PCK</h2>
        <p>APQ (Academic Performance Quotient) and PCK (Pedagogical Content Knowledge) are important benchmarks in my growth. The APQ helped me track my academic progress while PCK reflects my deepening understanding of how to teach and engage students effectively.
